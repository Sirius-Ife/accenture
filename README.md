# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for a comprehensive data analytics project completed as part of a job simulation at Accenture. The project encompasses data cleaning, merging, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). It was undertaken by Ifeoluwa Abe under the guidance of mentors at Accenture.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Rigorous preprocessing of raw datasets to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Data Merging**: Integration of multiple datasets based on common identifiers or keys to create a unified dataset.
3. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Extraction of relevant data, transformation into a usable format, and loading into a target database or file.
4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: In-depth exploration of data distributions, relationships, and patterns using visualizations and statistical techniques.
5. **Final File Creation**: Writing out the cleaned and merged dataset for further analysis or reporting purposes.
6. **Presentation Creation**: Development of a PowerPoint presentation to succinctly summarize project findings and insights.

## Technologies Used

- R programming language for data cleaning, merging, and analysis.
- Dplyr and Tidyr packages for efficient data manipulation.
- ggplot2 package for creating insightful data visualizations.
- PowerPoint for crafting the project presentation.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains both raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
- **Code**: Houses R scripts for each stage of the project, from data cleaning to EDA.
- **Documentation**: Provides detailed documentation, including a README, project overview, and any supplementary files.
- **Results**: Includes the final dataset file and the PowerPoint presentation summarizing project outcomes.

## Getting Started

To replicate the project or explore the analysis results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including R, dplyr, ggplot2, and PowerPoint.
3. Navigate to the `Code` directory and execute the R scripts in the specified order.
4. Review the final dataset file located in the `top_categories` directory for insights gleaned from the analysis.
5. Access the PowerPoint presentation in the `top_categories` directory for a concise summary of project findings.

## Acknowledgements
